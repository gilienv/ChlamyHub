Reconstruction of the Plastifical Genome

C.reinhardtii Chloroplast Genome with Full Annotation: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/BK000554

Steps to Follow:
1. Download the genome above -23 Oct
2. Get List of Gene names on Chlamy (above) -24 Oct
3. Find these genes on the currently assembled nodes of C. augustae -24 Oct
4. Map the identified C.augustae nodes (with gene names) to the Chlamy plastdial genome.
5. Attempt to reconstruct the C. augustae plastidial genome.


Need to update this page as the steps get done/attempted :)
